# Experiment 1b
## Remarks

Compared to the bachelor's thesis, there seems to be very little progress. This is because here, only the first 500 (vs. 2000 in the thesis) are rendered. The results are probably similar to the thesis when the full 2000 episodes are rendered.

# Experiment 1c
## Comparison

The original output (left) is too messy. Used running average to smooth the result and make it more readable (right).

# Experiment 1c
## Remarks
Only the first 1000 episodes were rendered (vs. 2000 in the bachelor's thesis). It's hard to say because of the noise, but the results look similar to those in the thesis.
